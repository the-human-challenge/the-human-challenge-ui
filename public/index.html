      <h1>Pledge your support for human challenge vaccine trials for SARS-CoV-2</h1>
      <p>In a typical vaccine trial, participants would be injected with either the potential vaccine or a placebo, then followed for several months to see who becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who doesn't. In a <strong>human challenge trial</strong>, volunteers are injected with either the potential vaccine or a placebo, and then <strong>intentionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2</strong> - allowing for the vaccine's efficacacy to be determined much more quickly.</p>
      <p>Show the world support for a human challenge vaccine trial exists by <a href="#pledge">pledging your willingness</a> to participate in a human challenge trial for SARS-CoV-2</p>

      <p>In a human challenge study...vaccine evaluation could be conducted in weeks rather than many months and efficacious vaccines could be made available considerably more quickly.</p>

      <p>In order to pledge your willingness to participate in human challenge vaccine trials, you must accept the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>I commit that I am willing to participate in a human challenge vaccine trial for <strong>even if no compensation is offered</strong></li>
        <li>I understand that participating in a human challenge vaccine trial means I might be intentionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 after being injected with a placebo, not the potential vaccine</li>
        <li>I accept that participating in a human challenge vaccine trial may result in short-term disability, long-term disability, or death - caused by either the potential vaccine or by COVID-19</li>
        <li>I'm willing to accept that medical expenses I incur as a result of participating in the trial may not be covered</li>
        <li>I understand that participating in a human challenge vaccine trial would likely require me to be placed in isolated quarantine for 14 days or longer</li>
        <li>To the best of my knowledge, I haven't been infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the past</li>
        <li>I understand that after this pledge, my name, photo, city/country and a link to my social media profile will by made available on The Human Challenge website</li>
        <li>I understand that this pledge doesn't automatically volunteer me for any vaccine trials and I will need to volunteer for actual human challenge vaccine trials separately, if they occur and I'm elligible for them and wish to participate</li>
